# Let's start playing with our data
# We look to the output file tagsByTime.out 
# This file, we expect, is generated by parsing out a collection of log files.
# Each row represents a 10 minute period of the same day and each column represents the count 
# of log tags accumulated in that time frame.
# e.g. 12   1   4
# would represent the 12th 10 minute segment of the day (1:50 am - 2:00 am), 1 debug log, and 4 warning logs
# Knowing what columns fit with which log tag is needed a priori knowledge. 
# I could make the columns explicit in the out file, but I'm lazy and don't feel like it; maybe another day.
# I'll list the order here (note this is subject to change without warning)
# DEBUG, VERBOSE, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
# ==========================================================================
tags = c("DEBUG", "VERBOSE", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "FATAL")

# Hmm, (can we)/(should we) use one of our config files (%projectRoot%/conf/dirpaths.conf) that our python scripts use to 
# derive relative paths for us?
infile = "./../data/output/tagsByTime.out"

# data is expected to be structured such that each row is a different time segment and 
# each column beyond the first is the count of the log tags counted in that time segment.
# 1   12    0   3
# 2   13    0   1
# ...
data <- read.table(infile, sep = "", header = F, nrows = 144, na.strings = "", stringsAsFactors = F)

# We expect the data is now structured such that
# data[1] contains the array of all elemnts in the first column (time seg)
# data[2] contains the array of all elemnts in the second column 

# What are my maximum values for:

print("=============== Minimums ===============")
for(i in 2:7){
